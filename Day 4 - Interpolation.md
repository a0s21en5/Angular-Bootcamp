## Interpolation in Angular

Interpolation in Angular is a technique used in HTML templates to dynamically display data. It allows you to embed expressions within double curly braces (`{{}}`) in your HTML code, and Angular will replace these placeholders with the evaluated value of the expression at runtime.

### How to Use Interpolation

To use interpolation in Angular, you simply place the expression inside double curly braces within your HTML template.

```html
<p>Welcome, {{ username }}!</p>
```

```html
<p>Welcome, Alice!</p>
```

## What We Can Do with Interpolation in Angular

- **Dynamic Content:** Interpolation allows for dynamic content rendering based on component properties or expressions.
- **Displaying Data:** It's commonly used to display data retrieved from component properties or services.
- **Concatenation:** Interpolation can concatenate strings, variables, or expressions to form dynamic text.

## What We Cannot Do with Interpolation in Angular

- **Complex Logic:** Interpolation is limited to simple expressions and cannot handle complex logic or method calls.
- **Direct Binding to Non-String Types:** While interpolation can handle string interpolation effectively, it's not suitable for direct binding to non-string types such as objects or arrays.
