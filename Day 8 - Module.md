# Angular Module

## What is a Module in Angular?

In Angular, a module is a container for organizing and encapsulating components, directives, pipes, and services. It helps in structuring an application into cohesive units with well-defined boundaries. Modules facilitate code organization, reusability, and maintainability by allowing developers to logically group related functionalities.

## Creating a Module in Angular

To create a module in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI command:

```bash
ng generate module user-auth/login
```

## Using a Module in Angular

Once a module is created, it can be imported and used within other Angular components or modules. This allows you to leverage the functionalities defined within the module across different parts of your application. Modules are imported using the imports array in Angular's NgModule decorator.

## Creating a Component Inside a Module in Angular

To create a component inside a module in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI command ng generate component "component-name". By default, this command generates the component files within the src/app directory. However, if you want to create the component inside a specific module, you can specify the module name along with the component name. For example, to create a component named "login" inside the "user-auth" module, you can use the following command:

```bash
ng generate component user-auth/login
```
